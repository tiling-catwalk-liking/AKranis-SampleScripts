The files in this repository are intended to show some of the scripts that I developed for use at the school I worked at.

The scripts were almost entirely intended for my own usage and not shared broadly. Additionally, much of the driving force behind them were unique circumstances and particularities of that environment, so those needs had to be accounted for (as an example the method for assigning groups in the AD account creation script was constrained by how the SIS was used to contain information and the wide roles some people played.)

To every extent possible, the scripts have been scrubbed of identifying information, and as such may seem slightly less straighforward, as missing references may remove context to why things are a particular way. Nonetheless it should highlight the scripting process and methodolgy.

A few of the items in the repo were for the computer lab and updating the kiosk PCs used by the students.

Permission was provided by employer to for me to retain all scripts made during time of employement.
